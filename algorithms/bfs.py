"""
Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm (uninformed)

## Functions:
    - search(agent:'Agent', all:bool=False) -> dict[list[str], 'Cell', int] | int: Perform breadth-first search to find the shortest path from the agent's location to the nearest goal or all goals.

## Main idea:
    The breadth-first search algorithm is an uninformed search algorithm that explores all the nodes at the present depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored.

    For each cell, the algorithm explores all its neighbors (in the order of up, left, down, right) and adds them to the queue if they are not blocked and have not been visited yet. The algorithm continues until it finds a goal cell or the queue is empty.

    The algorithm can be used to find the shortest path to the nearest goal or all goals in the grid. If the agent can jump over obstacles, the algorithm will consider all valid neighbors of the current cell, regardless of their costs.

    """
    Perform breadth-first search to find the shortest path from the agent's location to the nearest goal or all goals.

    ### Args:
        - agent (Agent): The agent object. Can or cannot jump over obstacles.
        - all (bool, optional): True to find the shortest path to all goals; False to find the shortest path to the nearest goal. Defaults to False.

    ### Returns:
        - If a path is found:
            - dict: A dictionary to store the result of the search with the following keys:
                - 'path' (list[str]): A list of directions (up, left, down, right) to reach the goal.
                - 'goal' (Cell): The goal cell reached.
                - 'count' (int): The number of cells visited during the search.
        - If no path is found:
            - int: The number of cells visited during the search.
