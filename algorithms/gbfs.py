"""
Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) Algorithm (informed)

## Functions:
    - search(agent:Agent, all:bool=False) -> dict[str, list[str] | Cell | int] | int: Perform greedy search to find the (seemingly) shortest path from the agent's location to the (seemingly) nearest goal or all goals.
  
## Main idea:
    The greedy best-first search algorithm is an informed search algorithm that explores the search space based on the heuristic value of each cell, which is the Manhattan distance from the cell to a goal. It uses a priority queue to keep track of the cells to be explored.

    For each cell, the algorithm explores all its neighbors (in the order of up, left, down, right) and adds them to the priority queue if they are not blocked and have not been visited yet. The algorithm continues until it finds a goal cell or the priority queue is empty.
    
    The algorithm can be used to find the seemingly shortest path to the seemingly nearest goal or all goals in the grid. If the agent can jump over obstacles, the algorithm will consider all valid neighbors of the current cell, and then choose the neighbor with lowest Manhattan distance to the current goal as the next cell, regardless of the cost to reach it.

    """
    Perform greedy search (informed) to find the shortest path from the agent's location to the goal.

    ### Args:
        - agent (Agent): The agent object. Can or cannot jump over obstacles.
        - all (bool, optional): True to find the shortest path to all goals; False to find the shortest path to the seemingly nearest goal. Defaults to False.

    ### Returns:
        - If a path is found:
            - dict: A dictionary to store the result of the search with the following keys:
                - 'path' (list[str]): A list of directions (up, left, down, right) to reach the goal.
                - 'goal' (Cell): The goal cell reached.
                - 'count' (int): The number of cells visited during the search.
        - If no path is found:
            - int: The number of cells visited during the search.
