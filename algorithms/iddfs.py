Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS) Algorithm (uninformed)
  
## Functions:
    - dls(agent:Agent, current:Cell, depth:int, visited:set, count:int, limit:int) -> dict[str, bool | int | Cell]: Perform depth-limited search to find the shortest path from the current cell to the target cell.
    - search(agent:Agent, all:bool=False limit: int=10**5) -> dict[str, list[str] | Cell | int] | int: Perform iterative deepening depth-first search to find the shortest path from the agent's location to the nearest goal or all goals.

## Main idea:
    The iterative deepening depth-first search algorithm is an uninformed search algorithm that combines the benefits of depth-first search and breadth-first search. It performs depth-limited search with increasing depth limits until the goal is found. The algorithm continues until it finds a goal cell or the maximum depth is reached.
    
    For each cell, the algorithm explores all its neighbors in the order of up, left, down, right and adds them to the stack if they are not blocked and have not been visited yet. The algorithm continues until it finds a goal cell or the maximum depth is reached.
    
    The algorithm also includes a limit parameter to stop the search if the number of visited cells exceeds the limit.

    ### Args:
        - agent (Agent): The agent object. Can or cannot jump over obstacles.
