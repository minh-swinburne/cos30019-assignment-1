class Agent:

    An agent in the grid.

    ### Attributes:
        - grid (Grid): The grid object.
        - cell (Cell): The cell object representing the agent's location.
        - goals (list[Cell]): A list of cell objects representing the goal locations.
        - reached_goals (list[Cell]): A list of cell objects representing the reached goal locations.
        - can_jump (bool): Whether the agent can jump over obstacles.

    ### Methods:
        - trace_path(self, cell:Cell, backward=True) -> list[str]: Given the goal cell, return the path from the start cell to the goal cell as a list of directions (up, down, left, right).
        - get_nearest_goal(self) -> tuple[int, int]: Get the nearest goal to the agent's current location (Manhattan distance).
