class Grid:
    """
    A 2D grid containing cells.

    ### Attributes:
        - height (int): The height of the grid.
        - width (int): The width of the grid.
        - grid (list[list[Cell]]): A 2D list of cells representing the grid.

    ### Methods:
        - is_valid(self, x, y) -> bool: Check if the cell at the given coordinates is valid.
        - get_cell(self, location) -> Cell: Get the cell at the given coordinates.
        - get_neighbor(self, cell, direction, distance - optional) -> Cell: Get the neighbor of the cell at the given direction and distance.
        - get_neighbors(self, cell, can_jump - optional) -> list[Cell]: Get all neighbors of the given cell.
        - reset(self): Reset all cells in the grid.

    ### Properties:
        - size (tuple[int, int]): Return the size of the grid as a tuple (height, width).
        - net_area (int): Calculate the net area of the grid (total area - blocked area).
